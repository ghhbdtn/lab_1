		<h3>Some information about cats :)</h3>
		<a name="cats"></a><p>Cats are one of the most popular pets in the world. These adorable, fluffy creatures are
			known for their playful and affectionate nature, and their ability to make us laugh with their silly antics.
			Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years, but their origins can be traced back much further.
			The first cats are believed to have evolved in Africa around 10 million years ago.
			These early cats were small and agile, with sharp teeth and retractable claws, which they used to hunt small
			prey. Over time, cats spread across the world, adapting to different environments and evolving into
			different species. Today, there are over 40 different species of cat, ranging from the tiny rusty-spotted
			cat to the majestic Siberian tiger.</p><br/>
